# Project 1: Exploring Regional Comparison of Participation rate and Performance in SAT and ACT: 2017â€“2019


### Background

The The Scholastic Assessment Test(SAT) and American College Testing (ACT) are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university. They are designed to measure a student's readiness for college-level coursework. While both tests serve the same purpose, there are some differences in their structure and content.The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)).
